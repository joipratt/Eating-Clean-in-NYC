Eating “Clean” in New York City

Abstract
What is NYC known for? Good food and big rats. Our project aims to help residents and tourists both figure out where in the city they can find the “cleanest” food while avoiding those pesky sidewalk critters.

We will do this by combining the two data sets listed above and asking some of the below questions. We hope to also integrate Google Maps API to pull in restaurant user review scores and distance from subway stops.
