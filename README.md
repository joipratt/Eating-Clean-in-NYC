Eating “Clean” in New York City

Abstract

What is NYC known for? Good food and big rats. Our project aims to help residents and tourists both figure out exactly where they do not want to eat.

We will do this by reviewing 26,000 restaurants that have received health code violations between 2010 and 2017. We will count how many violations each restaurant has received, count how many rat sightings have occured in the neighborhoods in which they are located, measure how far each restaurant is from the nearest subway, and finally integrate Google user reviews to form our own scorecard for each restaurant and determine the grossest restaurant in New York.

In New York, dining out is one of the best things to do, and we would like to know which restaurants we absolutely should avoid. WE WILL FIND YOU, WE WILL EXPOSE YOU!
