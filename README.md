Eating “Clean” in New York City


What is NYC known for? Good food and big rats. Our project aims to help residents and tourists both figure out exactly where they do not want to eat.

We did this by reviewing a data set of restaurant health code violations and a data set of rat sightings between 2010 and 2017. We counted how many violations each restaurant received, and integrated how many rat sightings occured in the neighborhoods in which they are located. We also incorporated each restaurants most recent health grade and built an algorithm to rate how "clean" each restaurant was.

In New York, dining out is one of the best things to do, and we would like to know which restaurants we absolutely should avoid.
